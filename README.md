# Libre-8
An 8 bit OpenSource full computer

This is <b>Libre 8</b>, an <b>8 bit OpenSource computer.</b> 

Inspired by the SAP-1 computer (Simplest As Possible). Contains 4 8-bit registers 
and it is able to address 24-bit memory addresses, having a total ammout
of 16MB of RAM.
The designs were made with <b>Logisim</b>, the microcode and the compiler
are writen in <b>Java</b>. The simulation is able to reach up to 4.1 Khz.

# Example program:
```
;; This is a comment
;; First thing is to write .data, and variables and function offset declaration below.
.data

;; Here we can define variables or function offsets.
;; A variable declaration is as following:
;; <name> <address> <value>
one 0000ffh 01

;; A function declaration is the same without value
addOne 0001ffh

;; To start coding you have to write .code (beginnings of the program)
.code
;; Similar to .code, you can define a tag using "."
;; We are now defining .Main tag. (saving the current offset of the execution in the name of the tag)
.Main
;; We will load value of 'one' var (01) to A and ADD one to its value.
LDA one
;; We call addOne function
B addOne
;; Ant print it on screen
OUTA

;; We define addOne function
.addOne
ADD one
STA result
BX result
```

You can also define running offset tags to help you to jump to (only backwards).
```
;; Same program as above with JNC to tag
.data
one 0000ffh 01
addOne 0001ffh
.code
.Main
LDA one
;; We define a running offset before the function call
.tag
B addOne
OUTA
;; We jump to tag to add on over and over again until carry flag is set.
JNC tag

.addOne
ADD one
STA result
BX result
```
# How to compile a program

To compile any code, you have to save it in a file and pass it
as an argument to <b>Compiler.java</b>. You can also simply name it "main.as" 
and place it on root folder of the project. If you run <br/>
Compiler.java on eclipse it will find ```main.as``` file.


# How to run the program inside the schematic with Logisim

To run the simulation, open Libre8.circ with Logisim. The file resides
inside ```logisim``` folder. Once the file is loaded, double click on labelled RAM component,
(see picture of circuit) and load the program you previously compiled on the component<br/>

Then you can Enable simulation and run clock. 

# How to write custom instructions
There are a total of 256 possible operation codes. Even you can create an operation code
able to fetch complex instructions, formed by several opcodes concatenated.

So there is the other java file, Microcode.java. Within it are defined the instruction opcode
in this format (0xab00). The opcode is just ab, but you need to write the trailing zeroes to
make the program work.

Once you have your opcode, write the following inside the main method (anywhere just below any previpus 
create<Operation>() invocations would do) the following sentences:
```
setOffset(OPCODE_CONST, icuadrant);
write(Signals.CO + Signals.MII);
write(Signals.RO + Signals.II + Signals.CE);
... your custom signaling goes here ...
write(Signals.clpcr);  
```
